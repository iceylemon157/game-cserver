# C++ Server Template and Sample Solutions for Sprout 2024

This is the source code repo for the C++ server template and sample solutions for sprout-c-2024-game.

## Sample Solutions

Sample solutions are under the folder `sample-solution`.

- `BestSaladUserAction.cc`: An example implementation of the optimal solution of salad only recipe mode.
- `StandardSaladUserAction.cc`: An baseline implementation of the solution of salad only recipe mode.
- `iceylemon-UserAction.cc`: My implementation of the best results, implementing MovingPipeline class to refactor the code.
- `iceylemon-UserActionOld.cc`: My implementation of the best results, using functions for moving instead of MovingPipeline class.
- `Sprout 大作業二 - iceylemon.pdf`: My report of the implementations.
